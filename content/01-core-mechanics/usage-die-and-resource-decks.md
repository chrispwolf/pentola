## Usage Die

Some special abilities and items will specify that they have a usage die.

Immediately after using an ability with a usage die, or one minute after using an item with one, roll the appropriate usage die.
If the roll is a 1 then the usage die is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain:

> **d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4**

When you roll a 1 on a d4 the item or ability is expended and the character has no more uses of it left.

{{< aside example "Using Your Usage Die" >}}
After Carina uses herbs from her kit to brew a tea to make the shopkeep more susceptible to her influence she must roll the usage die for her herbs, a d8.
Carina rolls the d8 which lands on a 1, meaning that one use from her herbal kit is gone.
The kit's usage die is reduced by one step to a d6, meaning the next time it is used Carina will roll that die instead.

If instead Carina had rolled a 2 or higher the usage die would remain a d8.

## Resource Decks

Sometimes, a character needs to expend tangible resources to acquire something or perform an action, typically when the item or ability has an associated cost.
This can be represented via decks of cards.

In Pentola, the cards in a suit go from 1-7, then Thief, Captain, Matriarch (the named cards, called _face cards_, all have avalue of 10 unless otherwise indicated).

{{< aside mechanical "Using a Standard Deck of Playing Cards" >}}
To use a standard deck of playing cards, remove the 8s, 9s, and 10s from the deck.
It's useful to sort the deck initially by suit, since how many suits you have access to often depends on the specific resource.
{{< /aside >}}

Every character has access to a deck which represents their own available resources.
When you have to pay a cost, you draw cards one at a time from your deck until you meet the cost, unless otherwise specified.

If your relevant ranking is _basic_, you look through your deck and choose one card to pay towards the cost.
The remainder must be randomly drawn from your deck after you reshuffle the remaining cards in your deck.

- If your relevant ranking is _comprehensive_, you may look through your deck and choose up to two cards to pay towards the cost instead.
- If your relevant ranking is _extraordinary_, you may choose up to three cards.
- If your relevant ranking is _incredible_, you may choose up to four cards.
- If your relevant ranking is _unbelievable_, you may choose any number of cards.

{{< aside example "Paying a Cost From a Resource Deck" >}}
Carina is plans to perform a ritual whose cost is 6.
Her relevant rating is 43, _comprehensive_.

She may look through her deck to select up to two cards to use to pay the cost, and chooses to use a 2 and a 4.
If her relevant rating was 23, _basic_, she would only be able to select one card.

She might then choose to use a 6 and not have to draw, or a 3 and draw a card.

Cards spent from your available resources are not automatically refilled; place them in a discard pile.
Different types of resources are refilled using specific rules for those resources.
