Bonuses to tests in Pentola come from several sources -- vocations, skills, relationships, and reputations.
The level of bonus a character has in each of these is the _rating_ of that vocation, skills, relationship, or reputation.

Reaching certain ratings in these bonuses unlocks a ranking, a general category for how profound that bonus is:

- Any rating less than 0% is _nonexistant_ (**N**)
- A rating between 1-25% is _basic_ (**B**)
- A rating between 25-49% is _comprehensive_ (**C**)
- A rating of 50-74% is _extraordinary_ (**E**)
- A rating of 75-99% is _incredible_ (**I**)
- A rating of 100%+ is _unbelievable_ (**U**)

In addition to adding the highest relevant rating to a test, sometimes the ranking is also important and additional effects or rules key off of that.
